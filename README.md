# 🕷️ Spider Mimic Quadruped

A biomimetic four-legged robot designed to replicate the movement of a spider. Built using Arduino, servo motors, and 3D-printed parts, this quadruped demonstrates simple gait algorithms to perform forward locomotion using IoT-compatible hardware.

## 🔧 Features

- Four legs with two degrees of freedom (DOF) each
- Spider-inspired walking gait
- Controlled via Arduino
- Designed using 3D-printed components
- Potential for IoT or wireless control

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Arduino Uno/Nano
- Servo Motors (SG90 or MG90s)
- Embedded C/C++ (Arduino IDE)
- 3D Design Tools (e.g., Fusion 360, TinkerCAD)
- Breadboard/Circuit components
